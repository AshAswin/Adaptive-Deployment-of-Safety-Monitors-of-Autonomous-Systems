# Adaptive-Deployment-of-Safety-Monitors-for-Autonomous-Systems

This work implements the algorithm described in [1]. Reformulating the given problem as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) is considered to be the major contribution of this project. Mini Zn (https://www.minizinc.org/), a library to model constraint satisfaction and optimization problems is used.
